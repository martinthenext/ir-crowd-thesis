Here accuracy of GP method is analyzed. 

```{r}
accuracy <- read.delim("accuracy_1_vote_per_doc", header=FALSE)
names(accuracy) <- c("Method", "Topic", "Accuracy")
accuracy$Topic <- as.factor(accuracy$Topic)
```

Number of observations per topic:


```{r}
one.topic <- levels(accuracy$Topic)[1]
length(accuracy$Topic[accuracy$Topic == one.topic])
```

Remove `NA` values

```{r}
accuracy <- accuracy[!is.na(accuracy$Accuracy), ]
```

Mean accuracies for topics

```{r results='asis'}
library(knitr)
means <- aggregate(Accuracy ~ Topic, accuracy, mean)
kable(means, format="markdown")

```
